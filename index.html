  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p> <b> Languages. </b> One of my strenghts is my ability for learning languages. I find it easy to learn a new language and adapt to it. <br> For now, I'm fluent in 4 languages: Russian, Persian, English and Kyrgyz. I've participated in a lot of olympiads at school and even got a chance to win. At the moment, i'm also learning German language and want to improve it.</p>
  <p> <b> Experience in Sport. </b>I had been doing rhythmic gymnastics for 2 years back in 2016, won one first place and one third place at <br> the competitions in 2017 and 2018. In addition to that, I have little experience in Taekwondo ITF, as i had been training  for a few months.</p>
